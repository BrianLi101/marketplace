/// "Seen" here means **opened**, not scrolled past. Anything else would need a
/// judgement about dwell time and viewport that the grid can't make honestly,
/// and a tap is an unambiguous act: the user chose this listing.
///
/// Facebook has no equivalent — it will happily show you the same sofa every
/// day for a week — which is the whole reason this exists. It makes two things
/// possible that the remote surface can't: an "only new listings" filter
/// (`Preferences.hideViewed`) and the recently-viewed strip on the home screen.
///
/// Keyed on `Listing.id`, the photo FBID from the thumbnail CDN URL, exactly as
/// `SavedListings` is. That key survives a card being re-parsed out of a fresh
/// DOM on a later search, which is the only reason a view recorded today is
/// still recognisable tomorrow.
///
/// **Deliberately not part of `ListingCache`.** Profiles there are evicted LRU
/// at a thousand, and eviction would silently un-see a listing — the record of
/// having looked at something is user data with a different lifetime from the
/// cached copy of what was looked at.
