/// Straight-line distance is a poor proxy for effort: two miles across the bay
/// is an hour, two miles down Valencia is a walk. This measures the route.

/// Named for where the numbers come from. Nothing here is derived from
/// Facebook: the destination is the point the map is already drawing, the
/// origin is the device's own fix, and the travel time is Apple's.
///
/// Two things bound what this can honestly claim:
///
/// - The destination is Facebook's *approximate* point, deliberately fuzzed,
///   so the answer is rounded to whole minutes and captioned as an estimate.
/// - Transit is ETA-only. `MKDirectionsTransportType.transit` is documented in
///   the SDK header as "Only supported for ETA calculations" — a travel time
///   comes back, a route never does. That suits this exactly, and is also why
///   nothing here offers turn-by-turn.
